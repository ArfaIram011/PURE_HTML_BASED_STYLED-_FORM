# PURE_HTML_BASED_STYLED-_FORM

* A SIMPLE PROJECT TO PRACTICE HTML TAGS AND THEIR ATTRIBUES...

  * ITS A PURE HTML PAGE WHERIN I TRIED TO ADD STYLES 

  (IN SHORT TRIED TO SEE WHETHER ONLY HTML CAN 
                  FULFILL THE NEED OF CSS IN DESIGNING WEBPAGES,
                           ATLEAST TO SOME EXTENT!)
